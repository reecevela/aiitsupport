2023-04-04 00:31:45,769 - INFO - AI response: If your iPhone is not opening, the first step would be to try restarting it by holding down the power button until the slide to power off option appears. If that does not work, you can try force restarting it by holding down the power button and the home button at the same time until the Apple logo appears. If you are being prompted for a password but do not remember it, you may need to reset your device to factory settings, which will erase all data.

2023-04-04 00:42:44,809 - INFO - AI response: Sure, here's a PowerShell script that installs software remotely on a list of computers:

```
$computers = "COMPUTER1", "COMPUTER2", "COMPUTER3"
$softwarePath = "\\SERVER\SHARE\SOFTWARE.exe"

foreach ($computer in $computers) {
    Write-Host "Installing software on $computer"
    try {
        $remoteSession = New-PSSession -ComputerName $computer -Credential (Get-Credential)
        Copy-Item -Path $softwarePath -Destination "C:\Temp" -ToSession $remoteSession
        Invoke-Command -Session $remoteSession -ScriptBlock {Start-Process "C:\Temp\SOFTWARE.exe" -ArgumentList "/silent"} -Credential (Get-Credential)
        Remove-Item -Path "C:\Temp\SOFTWARE.exe" -Force -Recurse -ErrorAction Stop
    }
    catch {
        Write-Error "Failed to install software on $computer: $_"
    }
}
```

In this script, you will need to replace "COMPUTER1", "COMPUTER2", and "COMPUTER3" with the names of the computers you want to install the software on. Also, replace "\\SERVER\SHARE\SOFTWARE.exe" with the path to the software executable you want to install. 

The script uses a loop to iterate through each computer in the list and then creates a remote PowerShell session using New-PSSession cmdlet. Once a remote session is established, the script copies the software to the "C:\Temp" folder on the remote computer using Copy-Item cmdlet. Then, it installs the software by invoking Start-Process cmdlet with the /silent argument to avoid any prompts or user inputs during the installation process. Finally, the script removes the software executable from the "C:\Temp" folder using Remove-Item cmdlet. 

If the script encounters any errors while installing the software on a remote computer, it will write an error message to the console.

2023-04-04 00:46:35,336 - INFO - AI response: Sure, here's an example PowerShell script that installs software on a list of remote computers:

```
$computers = Get-Content "C:\computerList.txt"
$installer = "\\server\share\setup.exe"

ForEach ($computer in $computers){

    Write-Host "Installing software on $computer..."

    $session = New-PSSession -ComputerName $computer
    Invoke-Command -Session $session -ScriptBlock { & $using:installer /quiet }
    Remove-PSSession -Session $session

    Write-Host "Software installed on $computer."
}
```

In this script, we first define the list of computers to install the software on. We then define the path to the installer, which is stored on a shared folder on a server.

Inside the `ForEach` loop, we create a new PowerShell session for each remote computer in the list. Next, we use the `Invoke-Command` cmdlet to execute the installation command on the remote computer. The `/quiet` switch ensures that the installation is performed silently, without displaying any prompts or dialogs.

Once the installation is complete, we remove the PowerShell session for that computer.

This script can be saved as a .ps1 file and executed from the PowerShell console or from a batch file. Note that the account running the script must have administrative privileges on the remote computers in order to install software.

```
# Define variables
$computers = Get-Content "C:\computerlist.txt"
$softwarePath = "C:\software\setup.exe"
$arguments = "/silent"

# Loop through all computers in the list
foreach ($computer in $computers) {

    # Remove the software setup file from the remote computer
    Remove-Item "\\$computer\C$\Temp\setup.exe" -Force
}
```

Explanation:
- The first step is to define the variables for the script. The `$computers` variable contains the list of computers that the software needs to be installed on. The `$softwarePath` variable contains the path to the software file that needs to be installed, and the `$arguments` variable contains any command line arguments that need to be passed to the installation.
- The next step is to loop through each computer in the list and perform the installation process. The `foreach` loop is used to iterate through each computer in the list and execute the commands for each computer.
- The `Write-Host` cmdlet is used to display a message to the user indicating which computer the software is being installed on.
- The `Copy-Item` cmdlet is used to copy the software file to the remote computer. The `-Path` parameter specifies the path to the software file, the `-Destination` parameter specifies the path to the remote computer and the `-Force` parameter is used to force overwrite any existing files.
- The `WMICLASS` object is used to execute the installation process on the remote computer. The `Create` method is called on the `win32_process` object, passing in the command to execute as an argument.
- Lastly, the `Remove-Item` cmdlet is used to delete the software setup file from the remote computer after the installation is complete.

Note: This script assumes that you have administrative access to the remote computers and have the necessary permissions to copy files and execute commands remotely. Also, make sure to replace the example values for `$computers`, `$softwarePath` and `$arguments` with the correct values for your environment.
