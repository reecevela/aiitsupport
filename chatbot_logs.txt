2023-04-04 00:31:45,769 - INFO - AI response: If your iPhone is not opening, the first step would be to try restarting it by holding down the power button until the slide to power off option appears. If that does not work, you can try force restarting it by holding down the power button and the home button at the same time until the Apple logo appears. If you are being prompted for a password but do not remember it, you may need to reset your device to factory settings, which will erase all data.
