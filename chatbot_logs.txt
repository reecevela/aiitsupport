1. The RDWeb server could be down -- to check if it’s down try pinging the URL, if you don't get a reply, it could be down.
2. The RDWeb login page could be cached in the computer's browser -- if you think this might be the case go to the browser settings  and clear the cache and cookies.
3. An issue with company firewalls -- if you think this might be the case contact your IT department.
4. Checking that you have a good internet connection -- if your connection is spotty RDWeb might not be able to successfully load.

2023-04-05 15:51:56,520 - INFO - AI response: You can use the PowerShell command `Invoke-Command` to install software on multiple machines at once. Here is an example script you can use:

```
$computers = "COMPUTER1", "COMPUTER2", "COMPUTER3" # Add list of computers here
$appPath = "\\SERVER\PATH\TO\SOFTWARE.EXE" # Replace with the path to the software you want to install
$arguments = "/S /v`"/qn`"" # Replace with the arguments needed to install silently

Invoke-Command -ComputerName $computers -ScriptBlock {
    Start-Process $Using:appPath -ArgumentList $Using:arguments -Wait
}
```

This script assumes that the software installer can be executed silently with the `/S` switch and that the installer supports passing in arguments with the `/v` switch. When you run this script, it will prompt you for the credentials required to connect to the remote machines.

2023-04-05 16:42:10,512 - INFO - AI response: Sure, here's an example PowerShell script for installing software on multiple machines at once:

```
$computers = Get-Content -Path C:\computers.txt
$installer = "\\fileserver\software\setup.exe"

ForEach ($computer in $computers) {
    $session = New-PSSession -ComputerName $computer
    Copy-Item -Path $installer -Destination "C:\temp" -ToSession $session
    Invoke-Command -Session $session -ScriptBlock { Start-Process -FilePath "C:\temp\setup.exe" -ArgumentList "/silent" -Wait }
    Remove-PSSession -Session $session
}
```

In this script, you will need to create a text file called "computers.txt" on the root of your C:\ drive that contains a list of the computer names, one per line, that you want to install the software on. 

You'll also need to replace `\\fileserver\software\setup.exe` with the path to your software installation file, and change the `"/silent"` argument to whatever command-line arguments are necessary to perform a silent installation.

Finally, make sure that you have the necessary permissions to run the script and install software on the target machines.
